# Pocketbase | Javascript | HTMX
This repo uses pocketbase  as a javascript framework with javascript, htmx and hyperscript.  This means there is no `express` or equivalent - PB handles all the routes - see `pb_hooks`. 

This repo follows the tutorial from [https://hypermedia.systems/](https://hypermedia.systems/)

It also demonstrates how to reference a NPM module in the server implementation - see [https://github.com/bartonhammond/htmx-training/blob/master/pb_hooks/new.pb.js#L27](https://github.com/bartonhammond/htmx-training/blob/master/pb_hooks/new.pb.js#L27)
